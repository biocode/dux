This is my implementation of Redux in Python. There are many like it, but this
one is mine.

I wrote it primarily to better understand<super>†</super> Redux but I also plan
to experiment with ideas from other projects (of mine and others) which have
some conceptual overlap with Redux, for example
[Rev](https://github.com/jtauber/Rev).

Thanks to Flora Worley for getting my excited about Redux in the first place.

## Examples from egghead.io video series

The implementation and the usage examples so far are mostly based on [Dan
Abramov's video series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux).

See `egghead_examples` for the code. Note these should be run with `python -m`,
e.g. `python -m egghead_examples.example3`

## Examples from Redux docs

`redux_docs_basic_example` contains a port of code from the
[Basics]((http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/)) section of the official Redux
docs. It doesn't really make sense to run because it's missing any of the
UI pieces but still might be useful to look at.
