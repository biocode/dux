This is my implementation of Redux in Python. There are many like it, but this
one is mine.

I wrote it primarily to better understand<super>†</super> Redux but I also plan
to experiment with ideas from other projects (of mine and others) which have
some conceptual overlap with Redux, for example
[Rev](https://github.com/jtauber/Rev).

The implementation and the usage examples so far are all based on [Dan
Abramov's video series](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux).

Thanks to Flora Worley for getting my excited about Redux in the first place.
